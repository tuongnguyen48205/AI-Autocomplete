# AI-Autocomplete
The recent success of generative tools has spawned many new applications and debates in society. A generative tool is trained on a massive dataset, for example, pictures or texts. Then, given a new input, referred to as a prompt, patterns in the prompt get matched to the frequent patterns in the model learned by the tool, and the contextual extensions of the recognized pattern get generated. This is a tool for generating text statements from prompts. In the first version of the tool, it learns a frequency prefix automaton from training statements. In the automaton, nodes are annotated with unique identifiers and frequencies with which they were observed during training, and arcs are annotated with statement fragments. For instance, the root of the automaton has identifier 0. Given a prompt, for example, “Hi”, the tool should identify the context by replaying the prompt starting from the initial node of the automaton. Then, given the context, the tool should generate the most likely extension of the prompt, that is, the extension that follows the most frequent subsequent nodes. 

The program reads input from stdin and writes output to stdout. The input is a list of statements, instructions, and prompts, each terminating either with '\n', that is, one newline character, or EOF, that is, the end of the file constant defined in the <stdio.h> header file. The input always starts with statements, each provided as a non-empty sequence of characters. If the line that follows the input statements is empty, that is, consists of a single newline character, it is the instruction to proceed to stage 1 of the program. Subsequent lines in the input specify prompts, one per line, to be processed in stage 1. The prompts can be followed by another empty line, which denotes the instruction to proceed to stage 2. The stage 2 input starts with the instruction to compress input statements, given as a non-negative integer, followed by prompts to be processed in stage 2 of the program. In general, the input can contain an arbitrary number of statments and prompts. The input will always follow the proposed format.
